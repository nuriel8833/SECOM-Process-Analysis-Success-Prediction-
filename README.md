# SECOM-Process-Analysis-Success-Prediction-
Project about analyzing data from sensors in a semiconductor manfuacturing process, analyzing it and building a model to predict if the test succeeded or not.

In this dataset, 1567 measures from 590 sensors were performed, with no info about the sensors or what they measures or in which units, and data about if the measure succeeded or failed. In this notebook, we will analyze the data, process it, try to reverse-engineer the data to get information about the process and build a model to predict whether a sample will pass the test or not , even without knowing what sensors measured what or which of them are involved.
